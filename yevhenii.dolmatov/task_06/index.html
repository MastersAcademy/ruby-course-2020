  <h1>Main steps in learning Ruby</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Step 1: Installing Ruby</h2>
  <p>First of all you must installing Ruby on yours machine. I prefer RVM installation</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rvm">RVM (“Ruby Version Manager”)</a></p>
  <h2>Step 2: Learn the basics of Ruby</h2>
  <p>There are many resources on the Internet to help you with this.</p>
  <p>But still I will advise you some resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://ru.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby">Ruby WikiBook</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming">The Odin Project</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Step 3: Read the documentation</h2>
  <p>Sooner or later you will get stuck in solving a certain problem.</p>
  <p>But don't despair <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/">Ruby's documentation</a> will help you solve your problems.</p>
  <p>Take a look at the documentation more often and experiment with your code.</p>
  <h2>Step 4: Time Management</h2>
  <p>Many people ignore this point. But it is the key to studying any science as effectively as possible.</p>
  <p><a href="https://dev.to/zhaluza/time-management-for-self-taught-coders-1o18">Time management</a> allows you to find a balance between study and rest.</p>
  <h2>Step 5: Learn Git</h2>
  <p>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files.</p>
  <p>Originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development.</p>
  <p>Thus, no matter what programming language you learn, knowledge of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">GIT</a> is required.</p>
  <p>And the sooner you start studying it the better.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I could describe more steps, but these are basic. <b>The main thing is not to stop, keep coding :)</b></p>
